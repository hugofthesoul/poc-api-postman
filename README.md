# poc-api-postman
Example Request for each API we use

How to use:
1. Get Postman: https://www.postman.com
2. Run Postman!
3. Import the relevant collection
*. Explore and Execute the relevant requests

Notes on merge:
- The collection files won't merge nicely.
- So after merge down please re-import the collection.
- And before you commit please export the collection (take default).

4. Set the "key" param to your, or our, YouTube public API key (please don't commit it).
5. Run and Get items[0].id.videoId
6. Check out www.youtube.com/embed/{videoId}

Note: There are two interesting arguments I haven't set "location" and "locationRadius".
We could in theory use them to find videos posted 'close' to an hospital.
